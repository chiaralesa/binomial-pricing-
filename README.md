For the Course of Mathematics II

Considering a binomial model Sn = S_0, Z_1, \dots, Zn with S_0 = 100, P(Z_k = U) = 0.75, P(Z_k = D) = 0.25,
U = 1.155, D = 0.9975, e^r = 1.05 be given.
(a) Derive the equivalent martingale measure.
(b) Consider pricing of a binary option F_n that pays 1 Euro if SN > K, where N = 10
and K = 200. Compute ( F_n)^{N}_{n=0}
Do the computations in R. Report F0.
(c) Compute the replicating portfolio. Report the portfolio for n = 0 and n = 1.
(d) Simulate paths (Sn), derive the replication portfolio along the path and check that its
discounted price ( \hat{Vn}) is indeed the same as ( \hat{Fn}). Report your results by plotting figures
etc.
(e) Compute the probability that the option ends in the money.
